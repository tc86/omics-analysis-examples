# HPC Utility Scripts

Shell scripts for file organization and job submission on HPC clusters.

**Included (to be added):**
- Organize FASTQ files across multiple lanes
- Simple batch submission wrapper (Slurm/qsub)
- File renaming / symlinking helpers

**Notes:**
- Scripts are lightweight examples and may need adjustment for specific HPC environments.
- Sensitive cluster-specific details (paths, emails, etc.) are replaced with placeholders.
