# omics-analysis-examples
A collection of compact, reusable code snippets and workflow examples demonstrating common analyses in oncology genomics and transcriptomics.

## Contents
- **`single-cell/`** – QC, clustering, and visualization (R / Seurat-like analysis).
- **`bulk-rnaseq/`** – Differential expression (DESeq2) and enrichment analysis.
- **`hpc-scripts/`** – Shell scripts for file organization and job submission on HPC.
- **`pyclone-snakemake/`** – Minimal Snakemake workflow for PyClone analysis.

Each directory has its own `README.md` explaining the context and how to run the example with toy/public data.

## Why this repo?
These are self-contained examples that show coding style, workflow structure, and reproducibility practices. They use either synthetic or small public datasets for demonstration.
